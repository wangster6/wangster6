My name is Ray and I am a graduate student at NC State University. I initially started my academic and professional journey in economics, finance, and wealth management, but have since discovered that my true interests and passion lies in the ever-evolving world of programming. I am currently pursuing studies whilst seeking an engaging computer science role where I can improve my skills, gain valuable experience, and actively contribute to a company's growth and success.
